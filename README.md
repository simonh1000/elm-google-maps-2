# MEEN-stack (Mongo, Elm, Express, Node) starter package

**Elm** (0.17) fullstack starter package with Pug (formerly Jade), Sass, Browser-sync and a Node-Express backend.

It is also possible to use the compilation functions *without* the node server.

To use, install and run...:

```
git clone https://github.com/simonh1000/elm-fullstack-starter
npm install
# the line above should complete by calling elm-package install, otherwise do manually

npm start       // == gulp

npm production  // == gulp build

npm compile     // == gulp compile

npm serverless  // == gulp serverless
```

Client side files are compiled into, and served from, './dist'.
